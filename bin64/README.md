### Note
1. Please Install **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019** for running binaries:
    1. For [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe),
    2. For [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe),
    3. For [ARM64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.arm64.exe).

2. The last thing is simply a matter of ***perception***. If you are running any sort of anti-virus, like ***ZoneAlarm, Norton, McAfee, etc***. then they will get a very unpleasant message about your program trying to do something considered ***dangerous***. It may be due to ***system(); function*** used in program. Read more about it [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/system/) and [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/j3wTURfi/)
